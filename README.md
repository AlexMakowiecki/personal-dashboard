# Personal Dashboard
## Introduction
It's a Chrome extension that replaces the page that appears when you create a new tab. The page shows general information (hour, weather, market currency) with a natural and relaxing background. 
The website was done to practice using multiple APIs, and modern interaction with them using async/await.
## Concepts learned in the course
  - Use of .catch() to run code when a Promise is rejected (normally because of network errors)
  - You can use await outside of an async function if the javascript file has the type "module".
  - Use of try()/catch() statements, to try a block of code and handle errors in it with catch.
